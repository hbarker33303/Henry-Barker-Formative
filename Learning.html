<p1>What is climate change?<br> Climate is the average weather over a period
   of years and so climate change is a shift in those conditions which go on to have deadly impacts.
   But what causes climate change? It can be brought about by a multitude of factors such as the use
   of oils and gas for heating and electricty which requires the burning of fossil fuels which releases
   greenhouse gases into the atmosphere the main offender of this is CO<sub>2</sub>. As shown in the
   images below climate change is becoming a key threat to our existence due to the drastically rising temperatures
   shown causing knock on effects.

  We aim to help protect <sp>our</sp> planet by trying to promote people to make 
  small changes in their life, which when enough people contribute can help make 
  a world of difference.<br>
  So what are some of the things you can do. We give you 5 simple things you could do right away to help make a difference.
  <ol>
  <li>You could cycle or walk to work instead of taking your car.</li>
  <li>You could try to minimise waste and ensure that all waste that can be is recycled. </li>
  <li>You could car share with a friend to help reduce overall energy consumption.</li>
  <li>You could reduce your energy uses by making small changes, such as turning off all the lights when you leave your home.</li>
  <li>You could help nurture your own local greenspace by volunteering to plant trees or on a smaller scale you could add more potted plants to your home.</li>
</ol>

<h5> What we do</h5>
<p>
  We aim to help make the world a more environmentally friendly place not just for the present, but for future generations as well. We want to help educate people who <br>
  may not truly understand the consequences of climate change and so we can raise this understanding to make a more sustainable future.

    <p>Climate change is the greatest environmental challenge the world has ever faced, but we can do something about it.

      We are the last generation that can stop devastating climate change. We have the knowledge and the tools â€“ we just need politicians to lead the way

  <p>The table below outlines different greenhouse gases which contribute to climate change and how we can reduce them:</p>            
  <table class="table table-bordered" style="table-color: black;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Greenhouse Gas</th>
        <th>How its produced</th>
        <th>How to reduce it</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>CO<sub>2</sub>-Carbon Dioxide</td>
        <td>CO<sub>2</sub> is released by all organisms when they respire which is when we take in oxygen to create energy and as a result we release CO<sub>2</sub><br>
        It is also created in the burning of fossil fuels in order to generate energy </td>
        <td>One way to help reduce the levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in our atmosphere is through planting more trees as they take in and store it when they photosynthesise.<br>
        Another way to reduce these levels is through being more energy effecient and switching to more renewable energy sources such as wind energy. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CH<sub>4</sub>-Methane</td>
        <td>Methane is emitted during the production and transport of coal, natural gas and oil and is also created from livestock and by the decay of organic waste in landfill sites.</td>
        <td>There are a few ways we could go about the reduction of methane, firstly in the prevention of burning fields after harvest.<br>
        Another way is by monitoring feed for livestock as certain foods can make them produce more methane.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>N<sub>2</sub>O-Nitrus Oxide</td>
        <td>Nitrous oxide is generally emitted from big industries through fossil fuel combustions.</td>
        <td>We can help to tackle this problem by raising awareness and information of the damages that this greenhouse gas can create and by investing in technological upgrades that require less fossil fuel combustion.</td>
